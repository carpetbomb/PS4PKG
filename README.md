# PS4PKG
A PS4 fPKG Game list using the psxhax site
All links included are from psxhax.com and I claim no ownership over any of their contents.

Some background:
I initially started work on this version on the 15th July and have slowly worked on it and added more features.
The first version using psxhax was made on the 14th May and worked very differently and was way more complicated and time consuming to use

The very first fPKG viewer I made uses dlps and was made when I was a lot less used to python


# Installation
First things first you're gonna need Python, you can get it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you've got python installed open up 'install.bat' and wait for it to finish installing / updating each component.

To run the program click into the folder path, type 'cmd' and then 'python app.py'

You will be prompted to enter your psxhax cookie values.

These are stored locally in the cache folder in plaintext and are only passed to psxhax and nowhere else. (you can confirm this by reading through the code)

while I plan to add some encryption on these cookies it is not a priority at the moment as nothing in the file indicates what site they are for
# Bugs
Please make me aware of any bugs you come across!

Known Bugs:
- The 'X' Close buttons do not work [this is a problem with the gui so I cannot fix]
